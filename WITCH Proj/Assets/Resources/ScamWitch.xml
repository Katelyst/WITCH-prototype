      <Greeting>Hello, protagonist! You're just in time for your latest lesson, my favourite (and only) student...! To get rid of that stupid magic vine we need a good old pyrokinesis potion. Do you remember it from your latest lesson?

      <Tree0>Those chumps think their "weedkiller" will do the job, but I doubt it. We need some toadskin vinegar to make the potion, could you get it? I promise to treat you to your favourite CDs when we get inside the mall!

      <Tree1>Hmmm. There's a park nearby where a few of these nice toads live. If you ask them nicely I'm sure they will give you some of their...juices. It works as a good day cream as well! They're amazing singers too. Off to it! Mom doesn't have all day.
